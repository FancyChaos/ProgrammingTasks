Write a simple number guessing game. The user should try to guess a number.
If he guessed it right, he wins the game.

Short but detailed:
At the beginning a random number between your choice should be generated and the user should be told so.(random, print)
Than the user needs to guess, what number was generated.(input)
To help the user out, the program should give the user feedback, if his
guessed number is lower or higher as the one he needs to guess.(if-conditions, print)
If the user guessed the number correctly, he should be notified that he won.(print)
Than he can choose to play again or quit(input, if-conditions)

Advice:
A while loop is very handy!
Be careful not to generate the random number everytime again!

Advanced:
The user can only guess a limited time(e.g. after 5 guesses he loses)(for-loop).
Keep track of the user score and print it after every round.

Very advanced:
Two player mode!
Each player has one turn to guess the right number, if he is wrong it's the other players turn.
The player which guessed the number first is the winner.
