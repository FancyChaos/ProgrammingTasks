Learn to use the Python Module multiprocessing that is used to run code simultaneously on different cpu cores.

1. Create a simple script that calls a method in multiple processes
2. Use the script of the prime calculation to write a multiprocessing variation

Challenge
Read about the Summenverfahren to calculate prims
http://www.geraldbuehler.de/primzahlen/
Try to calculate primes with this algorithm
-> Why is this algoithm not easy to use with multiprocessing?
