The task is to write a Python script, which will run the command 
"wget -m <url> -P <directory>"
This command will download every file on a given webpage and put it in the given directory.

Than the script should copy every file of a specific type into another folder, like every .png image. The user can choose at the beginning, where and which files they want to save.

Advice:
Run the solution first, to see what the program should do (don't look at it!!!)
Use the library sh! This is an excellent library to interact with linux porgrams (You need to download/install it with pip)
Make use of Python3+ features like pathlib!
Validate the input of the user.

Keep in mind:
The solution is heavely optimized for Python3+ and uses a external
(but great) library called sh
