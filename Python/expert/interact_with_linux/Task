The task is to write a Python script that will run the command
"wget -m <url> -P <directory>"
This command will download every file on a given webpage and put it in the given directory.

Then, the script should copy every file of a specific type into another folder, like every .png image. The user can choose at the beginning, where and which files they want to save.

Advice:
Run the solution first to see what the program should do (don't look at the source code!!!)
Use the library sh! It's an excellent library to interact with linux programs (You may need to download/install it using pip or your package manager)
Make use of Python3+ features like pathlib!
Validate the input of the user.

Keep in mind:
The solution is heavily optimized for Python3+ and uses a external
(but great) library called sh.
