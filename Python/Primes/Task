First prime numbers are:
2,3,5,7,11,13....

Advice:
- Use the modulo operator (%) to compute the rest of a division

Advanced / Challenge:
- Optimizie your algorithm and your code to make your program run faster.
- Use the time module (or timeit) to measure the runtime of your code.

Challenge Lvl 10000:
- Can you write a program that uses multiprocessing to caulculate prime numbers
up to a limit?
- How many numbers can be checked from a known set of prime numbers?
