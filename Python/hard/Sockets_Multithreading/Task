This task is about the Socket module and the thread module

1. Learn about the Socket module and create a simple server that echos everything a client writes
2. Learn about the Threading module and try to build a server accepting multiple clients

Challenge:
Create a python chatroom, where clients can chat with each other

Tip:
The chatroom can't use input() to get the players messages
because incoming messages break the input listening.
