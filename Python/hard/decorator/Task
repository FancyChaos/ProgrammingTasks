Decorators are a handy feature which may be used for many purposes in python.
Read this very good (advanced) guide before starting this task:

Now lets do some evil stuff! We focus on decorating functions here, but as we've
learned much more is possible!

Write a decorator for a function...
...that makes the function callable for N times, then throws an error
...that memorizes all function call results, but return a random one
...that "throws a coin" to check if function executes or throws error
...that takes a sequence of forbidden characters which are not allowed in function source code
...that takes a character map containing limits for chars to be used, e.g. only 3 "e" and 4 "a"
