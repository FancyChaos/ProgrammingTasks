Object Oriented Programming!
Write a script that contains multiple classes:
- a "Fruit" class
- an "Apple" class that inherits from "Fruit"
- a "Grape" class that inherits from "Fruit"

Instances of the Fruit class should have an attribute that contains information regarding whether it's ripe. There should also be a method that changes this so that a fruit can ripen.

Instances of the Apple class have to be initialized with a color (e.g. "red" or "green").

Instances of the Grape class have to be initialized with information regarding their variant (e.g. "seedless" or "seedy").
Also they should be special regarding their ripening: When ripe() is called on a instance of a grape the grape should turn into a raisin (is_raisin = False -> True)

At the end, create an red-apple-object, a green-apple-object and a seedless-raisin-object and print their properties.


Advice:
Make sure you understand the importance of "__init__".
Also be careful to implement the things above so that instances of a class don't share their attributes (one fruit is ripe while another one isn't) by using "self" when assigning values

Challenge:
Make sure that despite having to rewrite the __init__ function for Apples you still have a "is_ripe" attribute in Apple-instances
