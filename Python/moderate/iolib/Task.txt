Opening files is an every day task in python. Learn to use the io lib and consider
what do to when you encounter very big files like "myins.sql"
(download: https://www.file-upload.net/download-13644670/myins.sql.html),
which contains sql inserts for tables with more than 5 billion entries.

1. Open the file in python
2. Replace the characters that ruin the sql inserts in postgreSQ:
   Remove ` (this is called a backtick) characters
   Replace '????' with NULL
   Replace 1) with TRUE
   Replace 0) with FALSE

3. Save your work to another file

Challenge:
Have a look at the memory usage of your python script, for it loads the big files
into your ram ( Tip: Use python package psutil or memory_profiler )

See: https://pypi.org/project/memory-profiler/

Find a way to reduce the memory usage of your script
