To open files is important in python. Learn to use the ioLib and consider
what do to when you encounter very big files like "myins.sql" 
(download: https://www.file-upload.net/download-13644670/myins.sql.html),
which contains sql inserts for tables with more than 5 billion entries.

1. Open the file in python and print a few lines to the console
2. Replace the characters that ruin the sql inserts in postgreSQ
  (`,'????',1 as TRUE,0 as FALSE)
3. Save your work to another file

Challenge:
Have a look at the memory usage of your python script, for it loads the big files
into your ram ( Tip: python package psutil)

Find a way to reduce the memory usage of your script
