# Ideas/Suggestions for future tasks
Different programming tasks ideas can be found here which should get implemented in the future.

If you have a great idea for one then please write it down in this document and do a pull request so that others can implement your task :)
Of course you can implement you own idea by yourself, this document should just show what will be included in the future and serves as a notebook.

Suggestions for improvements of already existing task can be written down too.

You don't need to write down your idea in great detail, a small explanation of what the task is about and what should it teach is just enough.

If someone is willing to implement an idea he/she should put his name behind the chosen task.
That way there won't be two people who are working on the same thing.

## 1 - Basic OOP task (Will be implemented by Felix)
The task is to create a simple **Car** class.
The class should contain attributes related to a car e.g. how much fuel is left, as well as methods which will do something. For example a **drive** method which will drain the fuel of the car.

The goal is to teach the **fundamentals** of OOP in python.
