Write a simple program, that will roll a dice and ask the user after that, if he want's to roll again.
The user should be able to decide at the start, how many sides the dice should have.
If the user decided that the dice should have e.g. 6 sides, the program can only output an result between 1 and 6.
Just like a fucking dice, why all this explaining?

Short but detailed:
User decides how many sides the dice should have. (input)
The program than should simulate a dice roll. (random)
The rolled side should be printed. (print)
The user can decide if he want's to play again or want's to quit. (input, while and if-conditions)

Advice:
The while loop should start AFTER the user decided, how many sides the dice should have.
The if-condition to decide if the user wants to quit is inside the while loop.
You can exit a while(True) loop with break.
